Case Summary :
                A submarine is traversing underwater on the water-border of two countries at war.
                Mines are planted underwater behind enemy lines and we know that rocks are also present underwater as well.

Objective :
            We need a system to predict whether an object encountered by the Submarine's Sonar is a Rock or a Mine.
            So that it can traverse behind enemy lines safely.

Work Flow:
            1) Collect Sonar Data :
                                    from lab experiments on "metal cylinders" for mines 
                                    and various rocks were tested for 
                                    various features and 
                                    the data was collected in a csv format given in project files.
            2) Processing Data : Anlyzing the Data
            3) Training Data & Test Data Splitting : Here splitting is done in the ration 0.9(Train) : 0.1(Test)
            4)Supervised Model Application : Logistic Regression Model is used to carry out the following 
                                             because it is efficient and accurate for 
                                             binary classified data and prediction.
            5) Trained Logistic Regression Model : All training data is again fed to the model to determine accuracy of the model
                                                   Test data is then fed to the training model and again accuracy is checked
            6) New Data : New Test Case / Random Test CAse instance is fed from the data to check whether the prediction is corret or not
                          Process is repeated a few times so that the model gets aquainted with new test data and improves accuracy further.
